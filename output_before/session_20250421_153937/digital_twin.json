Meditation and mindfulness practices offer profound insights into the nature of consciousness and subjective experience, or qualia, by emphasizing awareness, self-reflection, and the nature of perception.\n\nOne way to integrate these insights into AI research might be to explore how AI systems could be designed to simulate or model aspects of mindfulness.
