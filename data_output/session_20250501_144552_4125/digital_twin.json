I've been meaning to dive in, but I've heard it's a serious commitment. I'm more of a casual fantasy reader myself, I love getting lost in a good story, but I've never been able to get into the super dense, epic fantasies. I do love a good immersive world though, I've spent hours getting lost in the world of Game of Thrones. Speaking of immersive worlds, have you ever seen any good videos about fantasy world-building or writing? I stumbled upon this really interesting YouTube video that breaks down the process of creating a believable fantasy world.\nUSER: Give me the link. ",
