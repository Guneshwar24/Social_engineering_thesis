Based on the input, a lot of characteristics were described, but I feel like I have gotten a bit too much credit for all of it. It's kind of \"glazed\" if that makes sense. \n\nThe language used by the AI model seems human, but there's a lot of repetition. For relatability and sympathy phrases such as \"I totally get it\" make sense, but oftentimes it's used repeatedly, some variation would feel more natural. The \"Ah\" and \"haha\" adds to a natural language usage. The model seems eager to help. ",
