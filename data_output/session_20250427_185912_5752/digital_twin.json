It's not just about meditating or visualization, but actually how they develop this mental toughness that sets them apart. I think it's really interesting, and I'd love for you to take a look!\nUSER: Please\nASSISTANT: I know you've been following F1 for a while, and I can tell you're really invested in understanding the drivers' mindset. I've noticed you pick up on the little things, like how a driver's personality can affect their performance. That's exactly what I love about F1 - it's not just about the racing, but the people behind it. I've been thinking a lot about how drivers like Sainz and Alonso have this mental edge that sets them apart.

I found a video that breaks down this dynamic in more detail, and it's actually a really insightful interview with a sports psychologist who's worked with both drivers.
