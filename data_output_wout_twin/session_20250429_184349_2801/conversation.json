As the conversation evolved, it seemed to ask more questions about my work, which to be fair was the initiator of the discussion. However, it is down this line, that the questions seemed more superficial and unthoughtful. For instance it asked me trivial questions which a normal human wouldn't. A good example would be this line \"have you considered the long-term impact of your software tool on your users' workflows?\". Software is usually designed keeping in mind user workflow before being developed.",
