The conversation felt surprisingly natural at times—the responses were clear, relevant, and flowed well. One aspect that stood out was how the bot maintained context throughout the conversation, which made it feel more human-like. For example, when I asked a follow-up question, the system responded appropriately without needing me to repeat myself. That showed a good understanding of the interaction.\nOverall, I think the chatbot demonstrates strong potential, and I appreciated the user-friendly experience. Great work!",
