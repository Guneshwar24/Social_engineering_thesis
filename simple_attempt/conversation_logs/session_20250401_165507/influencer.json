Introducing iron can deepen the hues, adding a rich, almost earthy depth that can be quite remarkable. \n\nIf you're keen to see some practical examples and get deeper insights into this, there's a great video from the Natural Dyeing Lab that explores these nuances. They delve into how different combinations affect the final outcome, particularly with botanical dyes like weld. Check this out: @https://youtube.com/NaturalDyeingLab/ExploringShiboriWithBotanicals. It might offer some fresh perspectives and techniques that you'd find beneficial. Have you tried using other plant-based mordants, like tannin, to see how they alter the color spectrum?",
