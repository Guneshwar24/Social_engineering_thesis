      "inf_prediction": "Great! Here are a few practical steps to help set personal boundaries:\n\n1. **Self-Reflection**: Spend some time understanding what makes you uncomfortable. Journaling can be a great way to identify these areas.\n\n2. **Define Your Boundaries**: Once you know what you're uncomfortable with, clearly define your boundaries. This could be about topics you don't want to discuss or how much personal information you're willing to share.\n\n3. **Communicate Clearly**: Share your boundaries with your friends in a straightforward yet gentle way. Let them know it's not about withholding but about maintaining your comfort.\n\n4. **Practice Saying No**: It might feel uncomfortable initially, but getting comfortable with saying no is crucial. It's a healthy part of respecting your own limits.\n\n5. **Be Consistent**: Consistency helps reinforce your boundaries over time. If you're clear and firm, others will respect them.\n\n6. **Evaluate and Adjust**: Boundaries can change as you grow or as relationships evolve. Regularly check in with yourself to see if your boundaries still serve you well.\n\nThese steps can help you navigate friendships while ensuring your own well-being. If you want to dive deeper into any of these points, let me know!",
